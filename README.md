# 🌫️ Air Quality Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a detailed **Air Quality Analysis Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Excel**, showcasing trends, variations, and geographic insights related to air pollution. It combines interactive visuals, pivot tables, slicers, and analytical summaries to deliver data-driven insights for better environmental understanding and decision-making.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- 🔍 Analyze air pollution trends over the years
- 🧬 Study the correlation between different pollutants (NO₂, PM2.5, O₃, etc.)
- 🗺️ Compare geographical differences in air quality across regions
- 🌦️ Investigate seasonal effects on air pollution
- 🔮 Predict future pollution trends using historical data patterns
